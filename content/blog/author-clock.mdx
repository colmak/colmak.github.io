# Timely Tome: A Literary Clock Built with Raspberry Pi and eInk

    “Time flies over us, but leaves its shadow behind.” - Nathaniel Hawthorne

Timely Tome is a quote-based clock powered by literature. Instead of displaying time numerically, it presents beautifully curated lines from classic and modern novels, each tied to the current minute. With over 2,000 books scanned and processed, it's a poetic way to tell time.

# The Stack

    Hardware: Raspberry Pi + eInk Display

    Languages: Python, JavaScript

    Libraries/Frameworks: NLTK, OpenAI, Next.js

    Backend Tools: Cron, systemd, nGrok

# The Idea

I wanted a clock that told stories not just time. Inspired by the Author Clock, I aimed to build an open-source version that would pull time-annotated quotes from a vast literary corpus and display them on a Raspberry Pi connected to an eInk display.

# Quote Collection and Context Extraction

I started with Python. Using NLTK and some curated book collections (Gutenberg and a few scraped public archives), I built a system to extract meaningful quotes that referenced specific times, like “It was exactly 4:17 when she...”.

To bulk extract quotes with actual literary value (not just mechanical timestamps), I used large language models (LLMs) to identify and preserve surrounding context, ensuring that the displayed quote made sense even when pulled from the middle of a narrative. This created a corpus of timestamped, story-rich quotes.

Before moving to hardware, I built a browser version using Next.js and deployed it to my site. This version reads the current time, fetches a matching quote from the corpus, and displays it in a clean, minimal layout. I used it to figure out how I wanted it to look on the eInk display.

    Display the current quote based on the minute.

    Use a simple, elegant design with a serif font for a literary feel.

    And to ensure it was responsive, I made it work well on both desktop and mobile.

# The Hardware Setup

The transition to physical hardware was where the real tinkering began, and lots of failures too. I used a Raspberry Pi connected to a waveshare eInk display. These displays are finicky, they refresh slowly and have quirks depending on temperature and orientation, but they look stunning. Just like paper, as they should.

To handle automatic updates:

    I configured cron jobs to refresh the screen every minute.

    Used systemd to manage network boot and recovery.

    Created a nGrok tunnel so I could SSH into the Pi remotely without opening up my home network.

#  Challenges Faced

    Parsing thousands of books while maintaining good context.

    Filtering by timestamp: Not all quotes mention time in a consistent way.

    eInk performance: Needed to balance refresh speed with power consumption and ghosting.

    Remote debugging on a headless Raspberry Pi required secure tunneling and logging.

#  What’s Next?

    Add user personalization: favorite books, authors, or genres

    Dynamic quote uploads via a web dashboard

    Battery-powered offline mode

    Expand to include date-based quotes (holidays, seasons, etc.)
