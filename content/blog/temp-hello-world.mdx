# Hello World!

This is my first blog post using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and MDX. I'm excited to share my thoughts and experiences with you.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX in your markdown documents. You can import components, such as interactive charts or alerts, and embed them within your content.

```jsx
function Example() {
  return <div>This is JSX in markdown!</div>;
}

<Example />;
```

I hope you enjoy reading my blog!
