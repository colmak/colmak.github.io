## Setup

First you will need a website that doesn't have HTTPS and acess to admin tools for the domain host.

In my case I had gotten a free domain with [Github Education]("[URL 'title text'](https://education.github.com/)") for namecheap, but even if you have a different domain host it should be similar.

## Cloudflare

Cloudlfare provides free SSL certificates which are what is needed for HTTPS. First create your account. Then find your way to the Websites tab and add your site.
