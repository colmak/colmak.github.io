### Notes

Recently I finished reading _First Person Singular_ by Haruki Murakami, and I wanted to share my thoughts on the stories I enjoyed. In efforts to give a veneer over rather than a summary and spoil the story, my reflections will be my focus.


## Preface

 _First Person Singular_ by Haruki Murakami is a collection of 8 short stories. It is about his memories. They are perplexing stories; there are times when it is best to think and absorb the fragments of memories, but not too hard, or it might just hurt. Reality comes packaged in a foggy jar...



## Story 1: Cream

Mr. Murakami got invited to a recital by a young lady that he hadn't talked to in years, and he ended up deciding to come. Leading to the most frustrating chapter, yet so strangely intriguing. The first chapter was the test for if I would continue reading the story, and I did. The preceding events in this chapter are such that they are not out of place, and you can vividly imagine the scene. Then there are times when you could very quickly overthink parts due to the seemingly purposeful ambiguity 



## Story 4: With the Beatles

The title created a sense of harmony amongst ideas prevalent among all the stories. Like many previous stories, the title gains depth to the journey when reading the entire novel. It started with a flashback, leading the author's thought to memory like none other, which I thoroughly enjoyed.

This story, in particular, gave me a sense of completion that the first story was lacking, though that most definitely was on purpose. There are some things left unsaid, but no good story fills all the gaps; what fun is there in that! 



## Story 6: Carnaval





## Story 8: First Person Singular
